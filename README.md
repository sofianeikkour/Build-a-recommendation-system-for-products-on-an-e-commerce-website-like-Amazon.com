# Build-a-recommendation-system-for-products-on-an-e-commerce-website-like-Amazon.com

**Context:**  
Online e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart use different recommendation models to provide different suggestions to different users. For example, Amazon uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time.   

**Objective:**  
In this project, our objective is to build a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products.  

**Data description:**  
Source: Amazon Reviews Data ([Data Source](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)). the repository has several datasets. For our study, I am using the Electronics dataset that I downloaded.
